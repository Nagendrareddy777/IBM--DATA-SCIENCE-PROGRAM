# Module Introduction
Dashboards and interactive data applications are crucial tools for data visualization and analysis because they provide a consolidated view of key data and metrics in a visually appealing and understandable format. In this module, you will explore the benefits of dashboards and identify the different web-based dashboarding tools in Python. You will learn about Plotly and discover how to use Plotly graph objects and Plotly express to create charts. You will gain insight into Dash, an open-source user interface Python library, and its two components. Finally, you will gain a clear understanding of the callback function and determine how to connect core and HTML components using callback.
